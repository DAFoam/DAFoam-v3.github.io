The objectives of this workshop are: (1) Introduce DAFoamâ€™s new features. (2) Have DAFoam users present their latest research. (3) Discuss how to promote a more interactive community.

Presentations:

(1) Ping He. Iowa State University. "Introduction to DAFoam's latest features".

(2) Chengyu Wu, Tsinghua University. "More generalizable data driven turbulence models based on FIML using DAFoam".

(3) Bernardo Pacini, University of Michigan. "Multidisciplinary design optimization of propeller-driven aircraft".

(4) Omid Bidar, University of Sheffield. "Data-driven turbulence model augmentation using DAFoam: sparse sensor placement, and aerodynamic shape optimisation".

(5) Uttam Padmanaban, University of Southampton. "Data assimilation of stalled airfoils using experimental reference data".

(6) Discussion: "How to promote a more interactive DAFoam community?"
