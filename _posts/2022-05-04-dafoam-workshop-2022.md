We will organize an online DAFoam workshop through Zoom on June 8, 2022 from 9:30 am to 12 pm U.S. Eastern Time. 

The objective of this workshop is to get you familiar with the new features and interfaces in DAFoam v3. We will also cover basic code development in DAFoam, e.g., how to add a new solver, objective function, or parameter.

If you are interested, please [register from here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbDdNzl0HEPEYeDShr8HGTOld4snHzN-5YUE7lFosAhOuk0g/viewform?usp=sf_link). We also have a few optional survey questions that can help us better prepare the workshop materials. Once done, you will see the confirmation message with the Zoom link on your web browser. We will email you the detailed agenda and slides before the workshop.

**NOTE**: We assume you are familiar with DAFoam v2. If not, please check the 2021 Workshop [Slides](https://github.com/DAFoam/workshops/blob/main/2021_Summer/slides/2021_Summer_Workshop.pdf) and [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9SKeQBuntzYf-3ubtfzmQ) before the meeting. This workshop has hands-on examples, so we strongly recommend you install [Docker](https://dafoam.github.io/mydoc_get_started_download_docker.html) and [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) before the meeting.

We look forward to seeing you.
